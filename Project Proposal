Project Proposal
For our capstone project, we are creating an application called the Education Access Insights Dashboard, which is designed to help people explore global disparities in literacy, school enrollment, and educational opportunity. Education access varies widely around the world, and we believe that a simple, interactive tool can make this data easier to understand. Our goal is to take publicly available education statistics and turn them into clear visualizations and insights that can support learning, discussion, and analysis.
We selected the World Bank Education Statistics dataset because it is reliable, up-to-date, and covers several important indicators such as literacy rates, primary and secondary school enrollment, and gender-based education gaps. The dataset is fully public and does not include any personal or sensitive information, which makes it safe to use and ethically appropriate for an academic project. One of our objectives is to highlight meaningful trends—for example, how literacy has changed over time or how enrollment differs between boys and girls across regions.
Our project is built using a full-stack approach. The backend will use FastAPI to create REST API endpoints that handle data retrieval, filtering, and insight generation. We will store structured data in a SQLite database, while the original dataset will be kept in Google Cloud Storage for easy access and long-term organization. The backend will include endpoints such as /data/upload, /data/retrieve, and /insights/summary, which the dashboard will use to fetch and display information.
On the frontend, we are building an interactive dashboard using Streamlit. Users will be able to choose countries, compare data, and view visualizations such as line charts for literacy trends, bar charts for gender gaps, and multi-country comparison plots. The dashboard will also include simple insight summaries generated from the backend, helping users quickly understand key takeaways from the data.
To ensure a realistic workflow, we are using GitHub for version control and collaboration. Our repository includes a clear folder structure, diagrams, documentation, and planned milestones. We will also set up a basic CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions to maintain organization as we work.
Our roles are divided to avoid overlapping code while still collaborating on design. Member 1 (Antonio)  is responsible for the backend, including FastAPI development, database setup, data ingestion, and Google Cloud Storage integration. Member 2 (Christina) will focus on the frontend by designing and building the Streamlit dashboard, creating visualizations, and setting up CI/CD. Both of us will work together on architecture.
