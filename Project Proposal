📝 About the Project

The Inclusive Growth Insights Dashboard is a full-stack web application that analyzes how economic opportunity is distributed across different communities. Economic growth does not impact every area equally — some regions thrive with strong access to resources and business activity, while others still face barriers that limit opportunity and financial inclusion.

This dashboard transforms Inclusive Growth Score data into clear visual insights that help users:

Compare levels of economic inclusion between communities

Identify regions with limited access to opportunity

Understand patterns in growth and inequality

Support data-informed decision making for community development

Our goal is to highlight where support and strategic investment may be needed to ensure that economic growth is fair and accessible for everyone.
