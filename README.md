# Capstone-Project-Education-Access-Insight-Dashboard
This project analyzes global education access using data from the World Bank. We built a FastAPI backend, a SQLite database, and a Streamlit dashboard to visualize literacy rates, school enrollment, and gender gaps across countries. The goal is to help users explore educational inequalities around the world through clear visualizations and data-driven insights.
Team - Christina Talbert - Frontend development, data visualization, and CI/CD setup. Antonio Maffett Jr - Backend Development, data management, and testing.
Planned milestones - Week 1 Planning phase (select dataset, write proposal, create diagrams, set up Github and figure out roles). 
Week 2 Frontend and Backend Development (Build FastAPI, set up SQLite, Build Streamlit UI, add charts, and connect frontend and backend). 
Week 3 Finalizing ( Write up documentation/presentation, prepare demo)
