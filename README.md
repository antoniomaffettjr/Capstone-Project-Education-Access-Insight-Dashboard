📈 Inclusive Growth Insights Dashboard
------------------------------------------------
A Data Visualization Capstone Project
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Project Overview
-------------
Economic growth is not experienced equally across communities. Some areas benefit from rising business activity and opportunity, while others remain historically excluded. The Inclusive Growth Insights Dashboard is designed to explore how economic access varies by region, helping users identify opportunity-rich vs. opportunity-limited communities.

Our dashboard translates complex Inclusive Growth Score data into clear, interactive visuals that support:

- Community development organizations

- Policy and social justice research

- Students and educators exploring equity in economics

This project focuses on real-world social impact by highlighting where investment, advocacy, and growth strategies are most needed.
