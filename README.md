# Capstone-Project-Education-Access-Insight-Dashboard
This project analyzes global education access using data from the World Bank. We built a FastAPI backend, a SQLite database, and a Streamlit dashboard to visualize literacy rates, school enrollment, and gender gaps across countries. The goal is to help users explore educational inequalities around the world through clear visualizations and data-driven insights.
